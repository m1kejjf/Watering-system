# Watering-system
Self watering system using python.

This system was designed for use on a raspberry pi to read the moisture level in soil and then if required water the plants. 
This system is created to water directly from a hosepipe tap with the hardware linked to the raspberry pi. 
This system was fully tested and also connected online to be able to remotely water the plants when logged in. 
Some of the system here is not 100% finished but it is workable code.
